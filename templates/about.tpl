		<h2>Your Files</h2>
		<p>Your files are yours.</p>
		<p>On one hand, this means you retain ownership of all the contents of your files. We won't snoop, and for the most part we don't care what you upload.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, this means you're responsible for the contents of your files. If somebody accuses us of hosting your kiddie porn, it's <em>your</em> problem. The same goes for copyrighted content.</p>
		<p>We don't like to intrude on our users, but we also think pedophiles are evil, and we don't want that crap on our servers.</p>

		<h2>Our Tech</h2>
		<p>We're going to support what we want to support.</p>
		<p>This means no legacy support. We won't support old, broken browsers. We won't even support <em>new</em> broken browsers. If you don't like it, go somewhere else.</p>
		<p>To be completely frank, this is as much a playground for our developers as it is a useful application for you. Fortunately, we like minimalism around here, so any changes will likely be unobstrusive. You'll have to actively use them, and if you don't, then you won't notice them at all.</p>
		<p>We haven't decided whether to open-source the server side. It's honestly not that interesting.
		<p>The client side is mostly ripped off from MDN anyway, so that's fair game.</p>
		<p>Here's a bit of what we use:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>PDO</li>
			<li>A custom ORM library</li>
			<li>Smarty Templates</li>
			<li>POJS (Plain Old JavaScript)</li>
			<li>JSON</li>
		</ul>
